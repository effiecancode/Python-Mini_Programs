ğŸ‘‰The code sets the initial value of the variable is_stop to False.
ğŸ‘‰It enters a while loop that will continue as long as the value of is_stop is False.
ğŸ‘‰Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter the number of hours worked and the rate per hour.
ğŸ‘‰The user is then asked to input the PF (Provident Fund) amount and the tax payable.
ğŸ‘‰The basic salary is calculated by multiplying the hours worked by the rate per hour.
ğŸ‘‰The total salary is calculated by subtracting the PF and tax from the basic salary.
ğŸ‘‰The calculated total salary is displayed to the user.
ğŸ‘‰The user is asked whether they want to calculate another payroll by entering â€˜yâ€™ or â€˜nâ€™.
ğŸ‘‰If the user enters â€˜nâ€™, indicating they donâ€™t want to calculate another payroll, the variable is_stop is set to True, which will exit the while loop and end the program.
